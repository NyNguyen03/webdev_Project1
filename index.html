                    <h2>About Me:</h2>
                    <p>As you can tell from the title and this page, my name is Ny. I am originally from Vietnam, and I am currently a student at the <strong>Illinois Institute of Technology</strong> majoring in <strong>Computer Science</strong> and pursuing a <strong>Master's in Cybersecurity</strong> as a co-terminal student. At the time of creating this website, I am completing my fourth year at Illinois Tech. I have truly enjoyed my time here, especially learning different programming concepts and improving my technical skills. This semester, I am learning HTML, which has been an exciting and valuable language to explore. Although I had heard about building websites before, I had never actually tried coding one myself. This class gave me the opportunity to build a website from scratch and better understand how web development works. I genuinely enjoy designing websites and using my creativity to make them visually appealing and user-friendly.</p>
